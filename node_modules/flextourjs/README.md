# Flex Tour JS

## First Release v1.1.0

## http://flextourjs.appspot.com/ (API and Demos)

## Purposes:
1. FlexTourJS was first designed so that you can show case your amazingly complex and powerful applications.
2. This framework gives developers the freedom to do whatever they want with a lot of different combinations of attributes.
3. FlexTourJS stays away from your applications, no modification directly made to your application's 'root' DOM Node. This is to ensure that some JS frameworks such as React will not fight against FlexTourJS to control the DOM.
